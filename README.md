# hello-world
YUP! so like, I have nooooo 
uncooked clue what I'm doing, 
but surely hoping to soon. 
Remaining the Challenger Mummy! 
Tanya Twista!

The pessimist finds difficulty
In every opportunity, and the
optemist finds an opportunity
to every difficulty! That's 
me! I refuse to pack up your 
grocery bag, or be your common 
teller at your local bank! 
I'm a panther with or without 
my team. I'll take you to the
water, but you have GOT to 
drink that crap yourself!
UNLESS OFCOURSE, we go further 
together and aim for that 
bubblegum shake? 
I have loved and I have
lost, even my entire family 
was a cost!
Including my little 6 year
old prince, Milano Williams; 
I witnessed the burial of my
Very own Son, together and 
laying right next to, and 
with  My Mummy Chereldene 
Hamann and more...

I JUST HAD to convert my 
insane, tormented and broken 
shattered mentality (and all
on my own by the way, as my
surviving daughter had to 
see some kinda light), I 
forced myself a better 
reasoning in my soul, that 
Heaven was literally falling
apart. So today I stand 
proud, that Father God chose 
MY family to kick some but 
around there, in order to save
more souls. 
Now, don't ya'll be jealous 
just because I'm the lucky 
one. Rather take my hand, 
and understand,I may have 
now become a solo silent band, 
but In my soul I know my 
family invested in me...
So I'm humbled, and glad...
Ms. Tanya Williams.
The Instrument Left Behind...
